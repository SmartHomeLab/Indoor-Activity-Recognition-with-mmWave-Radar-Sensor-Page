Nowadays, world population aging, which requires heavy investment of time and manpower in daily care, is having a heavy impact on society and economic of human beings. To caregivers, injury or death caused by fall-down and declined self-dependence due to Alzheimerâ€™s disease are two main issues to struggle on. Herein, we devise a human activity recognition (HAR) system which is potential to handle these issues. In contrast to traditional system using RGB camera, the indoor activity recognition system with mmWave Radar offers an service with low privacy leakage risk without costing any recognition accuracy. Taking the data of daily indoor activities as input, four deep learning models are trained and compared to build up an optimized activity classifier. The averaged accuracy of best model in test data set reaches 91.87%, which shows its full potential for practical deployment. A simplistic user interface (UI) is also designed to demonstrate the functionality of well-trained model. To implement distributed deployment, we connect Raspberry Pi to AWS IoT for real-time data collection and processing respectively. A probability threshold of fall-down action is set by AWS Lambda to trigger an alarming and call for first-aid in time. We hope the proposed system could provide an accurate recognition service which further enable the remote monitoring for elderly people and reduce labour for caregivers.
